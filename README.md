# LiveLayer
Bringing animated wallpapers to MacOS.

## About
I noticed that Windows had some great apps for animated wallpapers, but macOS lacked a similar experience. So, I decided to create my own! LiveLayer is a lightweight application designed to give macOS users the ability to enjoy animated wallpapers.

LiveLayer is only available for Apple Silicon devices as of now.

## Download
You can download the latest build here:

> Currently only Apple Silicon builds are available (to be completely honest I couldn't get universal2 or intel to build correctly)
[LiveLayer v0.0.1](https://github.com/CodingNewbieXD/LiveLayer/raw/refs/heads/main/LiveLayer_v0.0.1.zip)


## Future Plans
